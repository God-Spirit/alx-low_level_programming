Sometimes we need to perform arithmetic operations on pointers. But before using arithmetic operators with pointers we need to understand that we can not use each arithmetic operators with pointers. Pointer arithmetic is slightly different from arithmetic we normally use in our daily life
When we increment or decrement the pointer then pointer increase or decrease a block of memory (block of memory depends on pointer data type).
Note: Like the character pointer, when we increment the float pointer then it points to the next float location without impacting the stored data.
